## *Learn Basic PyGame Functions*
_With Example: How to Create a Start Menu :heart:_

This Repo contains some :arrow_right: **Python** `(3.10)` codes to create basic functions using :snake: pyGame (a GUI library).

We will be looking at an example of creating a start menu for a game (or any kind of programs).

:small_blue_diamond: Through these examples, I hope to help you be able to see how simple this library is and it is 
a great tool to learn coding in general while building a fun game/project. ***Understanding*** there are
many other game engines that allow you to create a game without coding, it is aslo :blush: super fun to 
create a game with very granular modifications as you have total control of how the 
elements/drawing/sound/transition/etc. should be.

:small_orange_diamond: As with Python OOP, objects are created and utilized, interations between classes/inheritance/etc.
the main principle is the same with OOP coding language and so learning to code in this way will surely
help you learn other object-oriented languages like Java for example.
